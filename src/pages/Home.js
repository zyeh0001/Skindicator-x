But one of the oddities is that even though the death rate from skin cancer has gone down, the incidence of skin cancer has skyrocketed in recent years, which is quite shocking. Are we so dependent on modern technology that we neglect to protect ourselves?
From the above statistical representation of the line graph, we can observe that in 1982 people by the age of 60, there is 1 out of 86 people has a chance of getting diagnosed with skin cancer, whereas 1 out of 650 people was dying because of skin cancer.
As of 2020, the chance of death from skin cancer has decreased, with 1 out of 1628 individuals dying from the disease. On the other side, the risk of diagnosis has grown, with 1 out of 64 people being diagnosed with skin cancer."
